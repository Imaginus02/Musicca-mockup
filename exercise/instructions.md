In the `integration` directory, you have a working implementation of the desktop mockup for the Musicca "about" webpage.

There are 2 mockups that represent how the website should look on a mobile webpage (screen size <= 480px).

Modify the existing integration, in order to make the webpage reponsive. The desktop version should not change, however, when
displaying on a screen size smaller than 480px, the webpage should look the same as the mockups.

You will need to use javascipt to create a menu button that toggles the mobile menu visibility.
